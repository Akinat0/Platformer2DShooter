# Platformer2DShooter
A simple 2D shooter with platformer elements

The main idea is to have an example of simple 2D game. So if I'll be needed in it, I'll use.
Also, I think here's an example of a fun game logic.

Interesting components: 
1) 2D player controller
2) The simplest AI
3) The simplest shooting
4) The simplest spawn system
5) Cool assets from openart
